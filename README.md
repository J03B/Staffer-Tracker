## Description

This project does not have a web-based deployment. Instead, this content management system (CMS) is deployed via the command line.

This application is a CMS that utilizing a SQL database to track staff members. It can be used to keep track of and report on member data, as well as providing a simple, easy to use interface for non-developers. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve data from the SQL server database. 

### Mock Up

The screenshot below shows the deployed Command Line Interface.

### Task Completed
The task here was to complete a project that would allow the user to keep track of staff member data in a command line user interface. Autonomy is essential to become a proficient developer, and saving time by easily storing SQL data would aid in those efforts. This challenge should set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned, meeting certain acceptance criteria with SQL and Server side APIs. The criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section. 

## Installation

This project is deployed on the command line; a local installation must be used by downloading the repo. The application uses Express to incorperate my own API that I've created. <b>Once installed, the application is started with 'npm start' in the shell. </b>

## Usage

This project is meant to provide an easy solution to tracking team members or adding/removing them on the fly. It can save them, delete them, and add tags to better organize data in each member's SQL rows. It uses APIs to save the data to persist.
